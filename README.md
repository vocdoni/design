# Vocdoni Design Assets

Source projects to generate the visual assets used by Vocdoni.

- `*.fig` files need to be open on [figma.com](https://figma.com)
- `*.png` files should be open with [draw.io](https://draw.io)
    - When exporting back to PNG, the `Include a copy of my diagram` option should be always checked
